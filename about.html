            <p>My name is Catherine Thy Le and I am a visual artist and creative, born and raised in Southern California. While having an
            interest and an attraction to the arts from a young age, I did not think of pursuing art as a career until the start of my
            senior year. From there, I began expanding from traditional mediums to digital mediums for illustration and design. Currently,
            I am pursuing a BFA in Digital Media Art at San José State University. I hope to grow and expand my knowledge and in digital
            mediums in my next few years at San Jose State and to begin establishing a name for myself in the creative community.
            <br><br>As an artist, I don't limit myself to what I can do. Digital and traditional mediums are all fair game for me. I use mediums
            that I find interesting, those in which I would like to hone in my skills with. The same can be said for my subject matter. I create
            artwork based off of what catches my eye. Recreation of landscapes, people, objects, all through my own lens. With my art, I want to
            offer the viewer an emotional experience- no matter how big or small. One where they feel happiness, peace, sadness, shock, anger, awe.
            I want my art to be a capsule for these emotions and feelings. I believe the beauty of art lies within how it is able to connect complete
            strangers regardless of their identity and background and I would like to provide a space like this for individuals in the future.
