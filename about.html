    <p>Catherine Th Le was born in Southern Caifornia. From a young age, I was interested
    and found myself becoming emerssed in the arts. I started off with simple pencil sketches
    and worked my way up to different mediums like ink, watercolor, and acrylic paint. As I entered
    high school, I started to take my traditionall art more seriously and was also intorduced to the
    worlds of design and digital artwork. Now, I am persuing a BFA in Digital Media Art at San Jose
    State University and working on learning more about digital art.<br><br>As an artist, I don't
    limit myself to what I can do. Digital and traditional
    mediums are all fair game for me. I use mediums that I find interesting, those in which
    I would like to hone in my skills with. The same can be said for my subject matter. I create
    artwork based off of what catches my eye. A recreation of landscapes, faces, objects, all through
    my own lense. With my art, I want to provide the viewer an emotional experience- one where they feel
    happiness, peace, sadness, shock, anger, awe. I belive the beauty of art lies within how it
    able to connect complete strangers regardless of their identity and background and I would like to
    provide that same space with my own art in the future.<br><br>Â© Catherine Thy Le. All Rights Reserved.</p>
