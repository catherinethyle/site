            <p>Hi my name is Catherine Thy Le, I am a visual artist and creative, born and raised in Southern California. From a young age, I was interested and found myself
            becoming immersed in the arts. I started off with simple pencil sketches and worked my way up to different
            mediums like ink, watercolor, and acrylic paint. As I entered high school, I started to take my traditional
            art more seriously and was also introduced to the worlds of design and digital artwork. Now, I am pursuing a
            BFA in Digital Media Art at San José State University and working on learning more about digital art. <br><br>
            As an artist, I don't limit myself to what I can do. Digital and traditional mediums are all fair game for me.
            I use mediums that I find interesting, those in which I would like to hone in my skills with. The same can be
            said for my subject matter. I create artwork based off of what catches my eye. A recreation of landscapes, faces,
            objects, all through my own lens. With my art, I want to offer the viewer an emotional experience- one where they feel
            happiness, peace, sadness, shock, anger, awe. I belive the beauty of art lies within how it able to connect complete
            strangers regardless of their identity and background and I would like to offer that same space with my art in the
            future.<br><br>© Catherine Thy Le. All Rights Reserved.</p>
