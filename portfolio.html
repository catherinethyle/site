    <p><a href="decision-by-clt.html"><i>Decision</i></a><br><br>As someone who has always been interested in criminology, thrillers, 
      and murder mysteries, this was a huge inspiration and driving force behind this piece. This game
      revolves around you, the player, who has to decide what actions to take after witnessing a woman’s
      motorcycle being stolen. One thing leads to another, which leads you to make an ultimate decision-
      one of life and death. I wanted to give the user a fun and interactive game that would keep them on
      their toes and engaged throughout. Along with the thrilling plot, I decided to visually enforce the
      game with background images that correlate to the location of each passage (which I got off of Google
      Images and edited in Adobe Illustrator). While the subject matter of the game is a bit heavy and dark,
      the aesthetic and visuals are bright and light, creating an intended contrast and irony. <br><br>2020.
