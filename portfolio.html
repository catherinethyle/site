      <a href="decision-by-clt.html"><i>Decision</i></a><br><br>As someone who has always been interested in criminology, thrillers,
      and murder mysteries, this was a huge inspiration and driving force behind this piece. This game
      revolves around you, the player, who has to decide what actions to take after witnessing a woman’s
      motorcycle being stolen. One thing leads to another, which leads you to make an ultimate decision-
      one of life and death. I wanted to give the user a fun and interactive game that would keep them on
      their toes and engaged throughout. Along with the thrilling plot, I decided to visually enforce the
      game with background images that correlate to the location of each passage (which I got off of Google
      Images and edited in Adobe Illustrator). While the subject matter of the game is a bit heavy and dark,
      the aesthetic and visuals are bright and light, creating an intended contrast and irony. <br><br>2020.

      <br><br>Thee Backyard Fairyscape<br><br>Being stuck at home for 8 monthes, there weren't many places I could escape to or new places for
      me to see or explore. One thing that has captivated me during this time at home has been the sky. It changes every
      hour of the day, is infinite, and can convey different moods. This piece captures how the sky, and nature in general,
      can have a serenic effect on us a mortal and finite beings. The gradients, color scheme, and
      soft brush strokes add to the magical and fictional aura the piece exudes as a way to put the viewer into
      a calming, far away, and dream enduced haze.<br><br>2020. Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.<br><br><br><br>
