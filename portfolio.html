            Embrace presents a woman who had surrendered. She is looking skyward, falling backwards, and has her arms open- in an
            embrace, in surrender, and in acceptance to whatever life throws at her. The fall is into a void of colors and mystery
            that has no end or beginning. By surrendering to ones vulnerable and raw emotions and by reaching a patch of darkness,
            you are able to find comfort and a way out. When you embrace your emotions and thoughts, you are able to find a new path
            and perspective, which allows you to leave anew and victorious.<br><br> 2019. Acrylic painting.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

            <br><br>The hardships that we face throughout life have a purpose. The word ‘Strength’ and the lion invoke the stability and
            durability an individual builds for themselves that leads to happiness and joyous experiences in life. When you rotate the image,
            you see the journey undergone to obtain said happiness. Through this lens, an individual reaches out, looking skyward from the depths
            of the ocean, surrounded by darkness and cruel words that haunt the depths of her mind. But the closer that one gets to the surface,
            the more light there is. Given time, we are able to leave the lonely and dark depths. The ugly parts in life are unavoidable. By exiting
            them, we are able to strengthen ourselves and become happier. The orange figure symbolizes happiness, which one obtains through having
            strength (red) and hope (yellow). Live without fear and unapologetically swim towards the surface.

            <img class="women" src="images/women.png" alt="women.png"></img><br><br><i>Women</i><br><br>
            This piece is meant to represent a small portion of women. It shows that women come in different
            shapes, sizes, and colors. This piece by no means encapsulates all women that exist, it shows
            just a few examples of what a woman can be. Through this piece, I want to show the power, beauty,
            and excellence of women and to let women know that they are amazing and loved. I hope to one day revamp
            this piece to represent more women on a grander scale. <br><br> 2020. Adobe Illustrator.

            In the wake of the strengthening of the Black Lives Matter protest from May and June of 2020, I wanted to create a graphic to show my solidarity with the Black community as well
            as one that would serve as a reminder to those who are not Black, that Black people are important and <i>equal</i> to us all. Black people have paved the way for many, if not all of us.
            This piece features Marsha P. Johnson in the center, a gay American liberation activist and drag queen. Marsha P. Johnson was an outspoken advocate for gay rights and a prominent figure
            in the LBGBTQ+ community and of the Stonewall Uprising of 1969. <br><br>2020. Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop.

            With the pandemic at hand, many places that would usually be frequented by many people are out of reach-
            like Disneyland. The glitching in this photo means to represent all the plans, ideas, and adventures
            that have been corrupted and ruined because of the virus, making them impossible and out of reach for
            an unknown amount of time.<br><br>2020. Audacity & Adobe Photoshop.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

            <img class="decision" src="images/thumbnaildecision.png"></img><br><br><a href="twine.html"><i>Decision</i></a><br><br>
            As someone who has always been interested in criminology, thrillers,
            and murder mysteries, this was a huge inspiration and driving force behind this piece. This game
            revolves around you, the player, who has to decide what actions to take after witnessing a woman’s
            motorcycle being stolen. One thing leads to another, which leads you to make an ultimate decision-
            one of life and death. I wanted to give the user a fun and interactive game that would keep them on
            their toes and engaged throughout. Along with the thrilling plot, I decided to visually enforce the
            game with background images that correlate to the location of each passage (which I got from Google
            Images and edited in Adobe Illustrator). While the subject of the game is a bit heavy and dark,
            the aesthetic and visuals are bright and light, creating an intended contrast and irony. Feel free
            to click the link above to run through and check out the game.<br><br>2020. Twine Game.

            <br><br><i>Thee Backyard Fairyscape</i><br><br>Being stuck at home for 8 monthes, there weren't many places I could escape to or new places for
            me to see or explore. One thing that has captivated me during this time at home has been the sky. It changes every
            hour of the day, is infinite, and can convey different moods. This piece captures how the sky, and nature in general,
            can have a serene effect on us a mortal and finite beings. The gradients, color scheme, and
            soft brush strokes add to the magical and fictional aura the piece exudes as a way to put the viewer into
            a calming, far away, and dream induced haze.<br><br>2020. Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

            <img class="the me" src="images/theme.gif" alt="the-me.gif"></img><br><br><i>The Me</i><br><br>The person and
            individual that you act is in front of others does not always reflect the true you. Many times, we bring
            forth a fake identity- whether it be in real life or on social media. The mask of not showing your true self
            will begin to surround you and proceed to swallow you up until you break (as represented through the flowers).
            The Me is a piece that shows what a person presents is not always what they are really going through or feeling.
            One can be beautiful and happy on the outside and still end up self destructing and being left a broken mess. This
            piece serves as a reminder to be kind to others because you never know what they are internally feeling and that we
            should all take care of our mental states and accept and acknowledge the emotions we feel.<br><br>2020. Adobe Photoshop.

            a more immersive experience for the viewer by having multiple points of motion with music playing in the background. It
            is meant to be hypnotic and captivating, lulling the viewer in. Feel free to click the link above to experience the full animation with music.<br><br>2020. VLLO & Adobe Photoshop.

            This is a short teaser video I created for the Cadre Mentorship Showcase "Colective Conscious". I wanted to feature images that would represent what the program is and what this showcase is (which is
            why I included pictures of the San Jose State University campus, which is the institute where this program is located, a colorful image that shows a person meditating and connecting with thier mind and conscious,
            a screenshot of newart.city where the showcase is being hosted, and of space, which I see as an element of dreams. Please feel free to check out the <a href="https://cadrementorship.github.io/showcase-f20/main.html">
            "Collective Conscious"</a> showcase, which opened on November 19, 2020 at 7pm PST, to see what the amazing mentors and mentees have created.<br><br>2020. Adobe Photoshop.

            <i>Lay with Me Beneath the Gemini Sky</i></a><br><br>Dreams. We all have them no matter how big or small. Dreams are vast, boundless, beautiful, and mysterious- just like space. Being heavily
            based upon stargazing, this surreal landscape transports the viewer to the middle of a plane surrounded by mountains under a cloudy blue night sky. The scene is accompanied by striking constellations
            and a red moon while ambient music and the sound of whirring wind plays in the background, providing a visual and auditory experience for the viewer. The title “Lay with Me Beneath the Gemini Sky”
            derives from the fact that the moon phase and constellations shown are based on those present on my birthday (May 23, 2002), with Gemini season falling from May 21 to June 20. This piece serves as an
            invitation to the viewer to pursue and immerse themselves in their dreams and goals and to bask in the beauty of their potential, imagination, and efforts. Click the link above to see the "Lay with
            Me Beneath the Gemini Sky" installation in the Cadre Mentorship "Collective Conscious" showcase. From there, you can also access the virtal reality installation of "Lay with Me Beneath the Gemin Sky".
